# Overview

Reckets is a cutting-edge blockchain-based decentralized application (dApp) built on the Polygon (previously known as Matic) blockchain network. The platform is specifically designed to facilitate the reselling of online tickets, with a primary focus on flight tickets. By utilizing blockchain technology, smart contracts, and integrating the Next.js framework and Moralis API, Reckets offers a secure, transparent, and efficient solution for users to buy and sell their tickets.

#How Reckets Works:
1) Ticket Listing-
Users can create a digital representation of their flight tickets on the Reckets platform. To do this, they first connect their crypto wallets (such as MetaMask) to the application. Once connected, users can create a listing for their ticket, providing essential details such as the destination, departure time, ticket class, and price.
2) Smart Contracts-
Reckets leverages the power of smart contracts, which are written in the Solidity programming language. These smart contracts govern the ticket listing and reselling process, ensuring a secure and trustless environment. The smart contract acts as an escrow, holding the funds until the terms of the ticket exchange are met.
3) Ticket Purchasing-
Interested buyers can browse through the available flight ticket listings on the platform. When they find a suitable ticket, they can initiate the purchase process by sending the required amount of cryptocurrency to the smart contract. This payment is held in escrow until the conditions of the transaction are met.
4) Transaction Completion-
Once the buyer receives the ticket, they have a specified period to verify its authenticity and accept the purchase. If the buyer confirms the ticket's validity, the funds are released from the smart contract to the seller, and the transaction is considered complete. In case the buyer finds any discrepancies, they can raise a dispute.

#Roadmap
We wanted to add more functionalities to the existing app and make reckets more secure but because of the hackathon timeline we have added the following to our roadmap:
> Implement Boat ticket Reselling
> Improve UI and UX
> Platform commission implementation
> Cancel ticket listing feature
> Many more small things...
